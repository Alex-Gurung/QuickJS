Building Your Own Copy of This Documentation
==============================================

Fun fact: This documentation is directly linked to Quick.JS' repository. Whenever changes are commited, these docs are rebuilt. Due to this, they should always be the most up-to-date and reliable docs out there for Quick.JS. **However**, if you, for whatever reason, want to build your own copy of the documentation to host locally, please feel free to. Open the `docs/` folder of the GitHub repository on your local machine in a terminal or command prompt (OSX, Windows, or Linux all work fine in this case). From there, just run `make html` to generate HTML versions of the documentation, or run `make latex` to make a LaTeX version.
